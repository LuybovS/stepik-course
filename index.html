   <h1>How to build a design system if you’re the only designer in a startup</h1>
   <img src="/img/1_MwBkqTW0KvCd1RUItekapA.png">
   <p>
      It’s always hard to be the only person in a company who is responsible for product design. Your day can be insanely busy because you deal with multiple things at the same time. You have to define a high-level strategy for a product design, delivering features, collaborating with product people, supporting devs and QA’s, user interviews, and much more.
   </p>
   <p>
      In addition, you always have to keep up with your craft. Figma is the main tool we use for all product-related features: all designs, explorations and brainstorming sessions live there.

      Shortly after I joined Statflo, we started working on a newly revamped app. During the process, I needed a design system that would allow me to move quickly and create prototypes in a matter of several clicks.

   <h2>Do not hesitate to use the open-source design systems available out there.</h2>
   <p>
      In the beginning, you do not need much. The majority of elements that you will be using are atomic components: buttons, dropdowns, forms, fonts, colours, etc. Initial styling of a system doesn’t matter- you can change styling afterward just in a couple of clicks.
   </p>
   <p>
      The most important things you need to look for in third-party design systems are flexibility and proper component nesting.
